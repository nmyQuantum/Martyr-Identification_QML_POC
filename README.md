# 🎖️ Martyr Identification using Quantum Machine Learning (PoC)

## 📌 Vision
Vietnam holds a profound history, yet hundreds of thousands of fallen heroes remain unidentified. Classical computing faces significant bottlenecks when processing highly "noisy," fragmented, and degraded DNA or biographical data from decades ago. 

This project explores **Quantum Advantage** to achieve:
1. **Speed:** Accelerated database searching through Quantum-enhanced indexing.
2. **Accuracy:** High-dimensional feature mapping via Quantum Kernels to find matches that classical algorithms miss.

## 🧬 Proposed Technical Framework
We aim to implement a **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach**:

* **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM):** Using quantum feature maps to project fragmented DNA markers into a high-dimensional Hilbert space, making non-linear patterns separable.
* **Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC):** A trainable quantum circuit optimized to recognize subtle biographical correlations (unit numbers, battle dates, and locations).
* **Quantum Error Correction (QEC) Integration:** Ensuring the integrity of sensitive historical data during the quantum state processing.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
* `data_preprocessing.py`: Logic for cleaning and encoding classical historical records into quantum states.
* `quantum_kernel_estimation.ipynb`: (Planned) Prototype for QSVM kernel calculations.
* `research_notes/`: Documentation on data mapping strategies for SDG 16.

## 🚀 Impact Goal
To provide a working prototype that assists national identification efforts, bringing peace to families and honoring the legacy of those who sacrificed for the nation.
